# Code to reproduce kinship estimates for paper "Projections of human kinship for all countries".

**Updated 2023.07.13**

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results for the paper:

Alburez-Gutierrez, Diego; Williams, Iv√°n; and Hal Caswell. (2023). "Projections of human kinship for all countries". SocArxiv: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hn3zm.

The scripts produce expected numbers of kin by type of kin, country, year, age of Focal, and age of kin for the 1950-2100 period. Projected values rely on 1000 probabilistic trajectories provided by the World Population Prospects: https://population.un.org/wpp/.

To run the analysis, execute the script 'main.R', which calls on the other scripts in the repository. The compiled results of this analysis can be found in: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FKCRHW.
